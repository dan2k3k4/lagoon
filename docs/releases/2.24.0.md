## Upgrades

This release requires lagoon-core (1.51.0) and lagoon-remote (0.97.0) to be updated at the same time (or one after the other) as there are changes that require both parts to fully work.

## Deprecations

There are no required actions or considerations with this release. As always, we suggest upgrading all minor versions.
